# Weather-application
This is a weather forecast application with a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. It allows users to fetch weather forecasts based on a given address and country code. If the same address and country code are entered within 30 minutes, the application retrieves data from cache; otherwise, it fetches new data from the backend.
